This project is about automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free.

The general ideas to look up are:

a. What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation.

b. What is malloc and free and how to use them.

c. Why and when use malloc.

d. How to use valgrind to check for memory leak.


Task #0 ask to write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

Task #1 ask to write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

Task #2 ask to write a function that concatenates two strings.

Task #3 ask to write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

Task #4 ask to write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

Task #5 ask to write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

Task #6 ask to write a function that splits a string into words.
